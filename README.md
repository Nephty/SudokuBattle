# SudokuBattle

## Introduction

Welcome to the SudokuBattle repository. This repository hosts the "SudokuBattle" project, founded by Nephty and Harbinger.
This project wants to be an open-source and free-to-play game where anyone can access the source code and have freedom to use as they wish, while remaining unbloated.

## Concept

SudokuBattle is a game where you can play Sudoku offline as a practice and online against other players in a competitive mode.
History of your games, profile creation and ranking, everything will make your experience as enjoyable as possible.

## Beliefs

Our keywords are :
* Open-source
* Freedom of use
* Bloat-free

We believe in open-source and internet freedom. We do not collect any data apart that you didn't enter by yourself on the application. This means that all we know about you is your profile and no external data is collected. We also ensure that no data will be distributed.
We want to make the game as simple as possible, keeping it bloat-free. Not requiring any phone number or e-mail and providing an automatic registration system with randomized IDs provides the most unbloated service there could exist.

## Contributors

Nephty & Harbinger are two university students trying to provide fun services while having a good time doing so. We want to show that you can stay minimalist and don't have to keep your code private or collect tons of data in order to create a good project.
